# Gender-detection-Model

Gender detection model built using deep learning technique of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detects and recognizes faces, whether man or women, especially in public places to classify the crowd accordingly. This model can be used in many circumstances like the public security, and banking thefts purposes.Face detection is used in biometrics, often as a part of (or together with) a facial recognition system. It is also used in video surveillance, human computer interface and image database management.

## Working of Model
Face detection applications use algorithms and ML to find human faces within larger images, which often incorporate other non-face objects such as landscapes, buildings and other human body parts like feet or hands. Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes -- one of the easiest features to detect. The algorithm might then attempt to detect eyebrows, the mouth, nose, nostrils and the iris. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found a facial region, it applies additional tests to confirm that it has, in fact, detected a face.

## Real-Time Advantages:
1) Improved security. Face detection improves surveillance efforts and helps track down criminals and terrorists. Personal security is also enhanced since there is nothing for hackers to steal or change, such as passwords.
2) Easy to integrate. Face detection and facial recognition technology is easy to integrate, and most solutions are compatible with the majority of security software.
3) Automated identification. In the past, identification was manually performed by a person; this was inefficient and frequently inaccurate. Face detection allows the identification process to be automated, thus saving time and increasing accuracy.
